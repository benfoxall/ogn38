    <h1>Hello</h1>

    <p>I want to use your phone/tablet/laptop as part of my talk at #ogn38, and it would be really great if you could do some things to prepare</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Have this page handy on your device (bonus points if you save it to your homescreen)</li>
      <li>Disable your lock screen (we'll need about 15 minutes)</li>
      <li>Share this url with anyone else who is coming along (the more the merrier)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Also, make sure you've charged your device - this eats battery</p>

    <p>Ben</p>

    <p>ps. Incase you're wondering - there's more content begind this page, I'll show you how to access it on Wednesday</p>
